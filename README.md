# SSR React / Apollo Client (GraphQL) app

A basic React app using Apollo Client, querying the test GraphQL API [https://countries.trevorblades.com/](https://countries.trevorblades.com/), rendered on the server. The app will slowly increase in complexity as we add custom React packages etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
